# bachelor_project
All codes from the workspace on the Raspberry PI of our bachelor project 
NB! Not in the exact way they are represented in the workspace folder on the RPi, but just to illustrate all the codes 
the most efficient way (for the bachelor report) 

Each node-folder has a package.xml, setup.py (used for building the package), as well as the Python code for the node. 

Extra files included: 
- logfile (from last final testings 19th of May)
- Plots/graphs from the sensor data (created by the logger_node as .png files)
- dockerfile.txt & docker-compose.yml (used to create, build & run the Docker environment)
- config.txt file (which is the config file for the Raspberry Pi located in /boot/firmware/config.txt)

Additional: 
- The project's BOM list is included (BOM_v√•k_field_flux.xlsx)
