# bachelor_project
All codes from the workspace on the Raspberry PI of our bachelor project 
NB! Not in the exact way they are represented in the workspace folder on the RPi, but just to illustrate all the codes 
the most efficient way (for the bachelor report) 

Each node-folder has a package.xml, setup.py (used for building the package), as well as the Python code for the node. 
Also included the last log-file (from the final testings 19th of May) with plots/graphs from the sensor.
